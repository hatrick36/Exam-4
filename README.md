# Exam-4
The following script reads in strings from text files and sets them to a string varaible which is then used as an argument for two functions. The first function takes in a string as an argument and calculates the observed kmers for any said string. After this calculations are complete the results are set to a list which is then sent to a data frame as a new column and final the function resolves. Next the second function Pos_k() is called and this function also takes a string as a keyword argument. This function then calculates all of the possible kmers from an input string through using the methods:(length(str)-k+1 or 4^k) which ever method returns a smaller value will be appended to a list which after completion will be add as a second column to the same data frame mentioned earlier.  Finally within the main function the linguistic complexity will be calculated using the sums of both columns of the data frame. This out pout will be append to the origional text file using the open() function and the file will now display the orgional string along with its linguistic complexity calculation.
